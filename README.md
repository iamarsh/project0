Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I have a created a basic website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap about my dogs.

As required, I have included both ordered and unordered lists, a table and many pictures.

I have used a stylesheet file named variable.css, which is compiled through variable.scss but also has additional attributes. I have used many CSS properties and CSS selectors including #id and .class 

I made use of the @media query on the Jumbotron - it changes its color to match the navbar when the screem size is limited down to 425px.

I have implemented Bootstrap's Grid model- used 4 columns (class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6") on all pages and also made use of 2 columns(class="col-lg-6 order-lg-2").
 
As mentioned earlier, I have used scss (variable.scss) which makes use of Inheritance.

It has the following HTML pages:

1. home.html 
This file is the main page of the site. It contains a Bootstrap Navbar, a Jumbotron and a Pagination component, taken from the official websie but modified according to my page.
This also includes multiple use of Bootstrap's grid model and a table with HTML anchoring. 

2. gallery.html
This page contains a Bootstrap navbar and repeated use of (class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6") which includes a lot of images.

3. bigboi.html
This Page is a bio page for my dog Big. It includes multiple uses of Bootstrap Components - one includes Image and an ordered list; and the other is a collection of just his images.

4. kuchi.html 
5. fugly.html
Both these pages are the same as bigboi.html
